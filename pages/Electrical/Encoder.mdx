You have to feed the A+ and B+ to the corresponding port in the back of the [HDC2460 motor controller](https://www.roboteq.com/docman-list/motor-controllers-documents-and-files/documentation/datasheets/gen3/60-hdc24xx-datasheet/file)

If you look at the back of the motor controller, you will see this

Port 12, 24 will take the A (Brown primary, white secondary) and B (Green primary, white secondary) from the left encoder.

Port 11, 23 will do the same but for the right encoder.

Take the 5v (Red primary, green secondary) and GND (Green primary, red secondary) and insert it into 13 (GND), 25 (5V), 1 (GND), 14 (5V) for each encoder.

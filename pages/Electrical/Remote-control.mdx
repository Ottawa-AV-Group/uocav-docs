For the remote control, the communication between the jetson and esp is done by the I2C lines. On the esp
you will see GPIO pin numbers on the PCB itself. As defined in the code implementation [here](https://github.com/uOttawaCAV/Remote-control-ESP32/blob/main/esp32-generic/components/I2C_Slave/include/I2C_Slave.h), pins are defined as follows\
21 - SDA\
22 - SCL\

From the ESP, you will need to make the following connections to the jetson \
SDA -> 3\
SCL -> 5\
GND -> 6 - Required so that the signals have the same ground reference\

On the jetson, there is a number indication on the corners for the GPIO pins.

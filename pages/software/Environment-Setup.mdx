# Setup 
## Option 1: Dual boot
If you already have linux system running on your computer, you can 
start install ros2 humble on your device. Follow the steps from 
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html. After, follow the steps from
https://navigation.ros.org/

## Option 2: Take the Jetson Xavier
No installation required

## Option 3: Docker image (Recommend)
### Windows
1. Install docker desktop 
2. Pull the image using ```docker pull ros:foxy```
3. Install vcxsrv ```choco install vcxsrv``` (Run the terminal in admin mode)
    1. https://dev.to/darksmile92/run-gui-app-in-linux-docker-container-on-windows-host-4kde
    2. You may need to install choco first if you don't have that on your system 
4. Run XLaunch program and run through the default configuration and save the configuration to %userprofile%\Desktop
5. Run ```docker run -it --net=host -e DISPLAY=[your-ip-address]:0.0 ros:foxy```
    1. For [your-ip-address], do ```ipconfig``` and find the ip of your local machine

Now you should have a docker container of ros foxy. If you want to install rviz and many of the other tools, you will need to go through
the installation process defined here: https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html <br/>

Import note: After going through all the ros foxy installation, don't forget to source the setup file. Ideally, input the 
```
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash 
```
into the ~/.bashrc file

### Ubuntu
For ubuntu systems, installing ROS directly on the system is recommended

### MacOS
Follow the installation steps shown here in the github but change out the ros:latest with ros:foxy
